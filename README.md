# Stock-Portfolio-Risk-Analyzer
PortfolioRisk Lens: A web-based platform that empowers retail investors to understand and quantify portfolio risk through professional-grade analytics and interactive simulations.

# 1. Problem Statement
# Problem Title
The Retail Investor’s Risk Blind Spot

# Problem Description
Retail investors increasingly manage diversified stock portfolios, yet they lack access to tools that translate raw portfolio data into meaningful risk insights. Most rely on basic metrics like daily gains and losses, which fail to reveal true exposure. Without understanding concepts like Value at Risk (VaR), Sharpe Ratio, beta, and correlation, investors:

Underestimate potential losses during market downturns.

Miss hidden concentration risks and diversification weaknesses.

Make decisions based on intuition rather than quantitative evidence.

Remain vulnerable to financial shocks due to unstructured analysis.

Professional risk analytics exist (Bloomberg Terminal, FactSet) but are prohibitively expensive and complex for individual investors. Spreadsheets offer flexibility but require deep financial modeling skills and manual effort, making them impractical for routine use.

# Target Users
Retail Investors – Individuals actively managing their own portfolios (typically 5–20+ stocks) who want to move beyond superficial performance tracking.

Finance Students – Learners seeking hands-on experience with portfolio risk metrics (VaR, Sharpe, Monte Carlo) without needing to code or access expensive platforms.

# Existing Gaps
No integrated web tool that automatically calculates core risk metrics (VaR, beta, Sharpe, correlation) from a simple portfolio input.

Lack of interactive scenario analysis – retail investors cannot easily answer “what if” questions (e.g., “What if a key stock drops 20%?”) or run Monte Carlo simulations to see potential future outcomes.

Visualization deficit – risk data is often presented as raw numbers; there is no intuitive dashboard that shows risk decomposition, correlation heatmaps, or simulation paths.

Accessibility vs. complexity gap – existing solutions are either too basic (portfolio trackers showing only returns) or too advanced (professional terminals, complex Excel models), leaving retail investors without a middle-ground option.
